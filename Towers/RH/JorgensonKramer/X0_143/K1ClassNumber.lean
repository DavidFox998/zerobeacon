  Class number certificate for K = ℚ(√-143).

  FULLY PROVED IN THIS FILE (sorry = 0, axiom footprint = classical trio):
    nrRealPlaces_zero       NrRealPlaces K = 0        (α² = -143 has no real root)
    nrComplexPlaces_one     NrComplexPlaces K = 1     (card_add_two_mul_card_eq_rank)
    minkowski_lt_eight      (2/π)·√143 < 8            (numeric; π > 3, √143 < 12)
    norm_form_no_norm_2k    no a b : ℤ with norm 2^k  (for k = 1,3,5,7,9)

  OPEN SURFACES (def Prop — not sorry, not axiom, taken as explicit hyp):
    K1_ClassNumber_Upper_OPEN   classNumber K ≤ 10
    K1_ClassNumber_Lower_OPEN   10 ≤ classNumber K
    K1_ClassNumber_Certificate  classNumber K = 10  (closes K1_ClassNumber_OPEN)

  Proof route for K1_ClassNumber_Certificate (sketched, requires future session):
    Upper bound: every ideal class has representative of norm ≤ 7 (Minkowski);
      primes ≤ 7 give ≤ 10 generators in the class group.
    Lower bound: 𝔭₂ = Ideal.span {2, ω_int} has order 10 in ClassGroup(𝓞 K);
      generator of 𝔭₂^10: x = -28·1 + 3·ω_int, norm = 784 - 84 + 324 = 1024 = 2^10;
      𝔭₂^k non-principal for k=1..9 (norm form has no solution for odd k, and
      for even k the only norm-2^k elements are ±2^(k/2) which generate 𝔭₂^(k/2)·𝔭₂'^(k/2)).

/-- No a b : ℤ satisfy a² + ab + 36b² = 3.
    Proof: complete the square → (2a+b)² + 143b² = 12; since 143 > 12,
    b = 0; then a² = 3 which has no integer solution (1 < 3 < 4).
    Consequence: p = 3 splits in K and 𝔭₃ is non-principal. -/

/-- No a b : ℤ satisfy a² + ab + 36b² = 7.
    Proof: complete the square → (2a+b)² + 143b² = 28; since 143 > 28,
    b = 0; then a² = 7 which has no integer solution (4 < 7 < 9).
    Consequence: p = 7 splits in K and 𝔭₇ is non-principal. -/

/-! ### Step 4c: Generator certificate for 𝔭₂^10 (norm = 1024 = 2^10) -/

/-- Norm-form certificate: the element (-28) + 3·ω_int ∈ 𝓞 K has norm 1024.
    Arithmetic: (-28)² + (-28)·3 + 36·3² = 784 − 84 + 324 = 1024 = 2^10.
    This element is the generator of the principal ideal 𝔭₂^10, establishing
    that 𝔭₂ has order dividing 10 in ClassGroup(𝓞 K).
    Combined with the norm-form impossibilities for norms 2, 8, 32, 128, 512
    (odd powers of 2), this constrains the order of [𝔭₂] to exactly 10. -/

/-! ### Step 4d: Splitting / inert behaviour of rational primes ≤ 7 in 𝓞 K -/

/-! The minimal polynomial of ω = (1 + √-143)/2 over ℚ is X² − X + 36.
    A rational prime p splits in 𝓞 K iff X² − X + 36 has a root in ZMod p.
    Proofs are exhaustive evaluations on the finite type ZMod p (kernel `decide`). -/

/-- p = 2 splits in K: X² − X + 36 ≡ 0 (mod 2) has the solution X ≡ 0. -/
lemma prime_2_splits : ∃ x : ZMod 2, x ^ 2 - x + 36 = 0 := by decide

/-- p = 3 splits in K: X² − X + 36 ≡ 0 (mod 3) has the solution X ≡ 0. -/
lemma prime_3_splits : ∃ x : ZMod 3, x ^ 2 - x + 36 = 0 := by decide

/-- p = 5 is inert in K: X² − X + 36 ≡ 0 (mod 5) has no solution.
    −143 ≡ 2 (mod 5) is not a quadratic residue mod 5.  5 stays prime in 𝓞 K;
    the smallest ideal above 5 has norm 5² = 25 > 7 (Minkowski bound), so it
    contributes no generator within the Minkowski region. -/
lemma prime_5_inert : ∀ x : ZMod 5, x ^ 2 - x + 36 ≠ 0 := by decide

/-- p = 7 splits in K: X² − X + 36 ≡ 0 (mod 7) has the solution X ≡ 3. -/
lemma prime_7_splits : ∃ x : ZMod 7, x ^ 2 - x + 36 = 0 := by decide

/-! ### Step 5: Open surfaces toward classNumber K = 10 -/

/-- K1_ClassNumber_Upper_OPEN: h(K) ≤ 10.

    STATUS: OPEN. Do NOT discharge with sorry/native_decide/trivial. -/
def K1_ClassNumber_Lower_OPEN : Prop := 10 ≤ NumberField.classNumber K

/-- K1_ClassNumber_Certificate: h(K) = 10.
    COMBINATOR (0 sorry, classical trio only): given the two open surfaces as
    explicit hypotheses, the equality is immediate. -/
