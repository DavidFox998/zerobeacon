Towers / Hodge / Twelve  —  documented 12 CM levels + OPEN
                            Bost-bound violation conjecture
================================================================

**THIS FILE IS NOT A BRICK.** It introduces the genuine, documented
12-element CM set from the certificate chain and STATES (does not prove)
the Bost-bound violation conjecture. It discharges no open surface and
makes no Hodge / BSD / mass-gap claim.

Real data only:

  * `exceptional_12 : Finset ℕ` — the 12 CM levels `N` of M10/M13 Table 1,
    `{27,32,36,49,64,81,121,144,169,196,225,256}` (the Lean `CM_LIST` in
    `docs/M10_CM_Descent.tex` line 292; identical list in `docs/M13_BC_CM.tex`).
    The two NON-square cross-check levels 289, 361 are deliberately EXCLUDED
    (they are not part of the main 12 per both papers' abstracts).
  * `CM_Curve` — a curve identified by its level `id : ℕ`.
  * `ExceptionalSet₁₂ : Finset CM_Curve` — the 12 curves; `twelve_card`
    proves `card = 12` (genuine finite fact, `decide`, classical trio).
  * `C` / `BostBound` — the Bost sum `Σ_{p∈s} log p · p/(p-1)` and the
    predicate `C s > 2√13`. Formula ATTESTED in M5
    (`paper/modules/m05-bostbound.tex`: `C(S_4)=Σ log(p)·p/(p-1)`,
    `C(S_4) ≈ 11.4221 > 2√13 ≈ 7.2111`).
  * `S : CM_Curve → Finset ℕ` — the prime set `S_X` attached to a curve.
    Kept `opaque` (NOT computed): the documents give `S_X` numerically only
    for `S_4` (M4/M5), so computing it for the 12 curves would require data
    not present. `opaque` introduces NO axiom and NO `sorry`.
  * `TwelveViolation_Surface : Prop` — the OPEN conjecture
    `∃ X ∈ ExceptionalSet₁₂, ¬ BostBound (S X)`. A named open surface,
    asserted by NO theorem. Discharges nothing; proves nothing.

DEVIATIONS from the drafted spec (forced by the repo's locked invariants):
  * `twelve_card` uses `decide`, NOT `native_decide` — `native_decide` emits
    the extra axiom `Lean.ofReduceBool`, which breaks the classical-trio lock.
  * The violation "theorem ... := by sorry" is replaced by the named open
    Prop `TwelveViolation_Surface` — `by sorry` emits `sorryAx`, forbidden in
    any registered file (`Towers/` is `sorry`-free since the 2026-05-31 purge).
  * `S` is the constant `Defs.S_14` (curve-independent, per the documents).
  SORRY: 0. Axioms: classical trio only.
