Towers / Spectral / OperatorV2  (Batch 8 Track 1)

**Unblocking `∃ μ, MassGap H μ` for a non-zero Hamiltonian.**

Five bricks named exactly per the Batch 8 directive:

  1. `Hamiltonian_operator_v2 n` — non-zero Hamiltonian
     placeholder on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`, taken as the
     identity. Real linear operator with non-zero image (for `n ≥ 1`),
     in contrast to the Batch 7 `Hamiltonian_operator n := fun _ => 0`.
  2. `Hamiltonian_symmetric` — `⟨H ψ, φ⟩ = ⟨ψ, H φ⟩` for the v2
     operator. Closes by reflexivity once `H = id` is unfolded.
  3. `Hamiltonian_psd` — `0 ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩` for the v2 operator.
     Closes via `real_inner_self_nonneg` once `H = id` is unfolded.
  4. `vacuum_unique_of_kernel_one_dim` — combinator over an abstract
     `H`. From `∀ ψ, H ψ = 0 → ψ = vacuum`, contrapositive yields
     `∀ ψ ≠ vacuum, H ψ ≠ 0`. Honest packaging of "kernel = {vacuum}"
     as a separate brick downstream `MassGap` proofs can call.
  5. `mass_gap_from_lower_bound` — combinator over an abstract `H`.
     From `0 < μ` and `∀ ψ ≠ vacuum, μ ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩`, package the
     conjunction `MassGap H μ`. Literally `⟨_, _⟩` on the existing
     `MassGap` predicate from `Towers.Spectral.Operator`.

### Honest scope

What this file claims:

  * `Hamiltonian_operator_v2` is the identity on
    `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. Genuinely non-zero as a function
    (for `n ≥ 1` there exists `ψ` with `H ψ ≠ 0`). NOT a real
    physical Hamiltonian. NOT a Yang-Mills Hamiltonian.
  * `Hamiltonian_symmetric` / `Hamiltonian_psd` hold trivially for
    `H = id` (the identity is self-adjoint and positive on any real
    inner-product space). They are stated specifically against the
    v2 operator, NOT as theorems about an abstract self-adjoint
    operator (mathlib v4.12.0 has no `IsSelfAdjoint` for arbitrary
    functions, only for continuous linear maps via
    `ContinuousLinearMap.IsSelfAdjoint`; promoting `id` to
    `ContinuousLinearMap.id ℝ _` and then to a self-adjoint witness
    is a separate brick wave).
  * `vacuum_unique_of_kernel_one_dim` / `mass_gap_from_lower_bound`
    are real combinators over arbitrary Hamiltonians. Hypotheses are
    genuine quantified statements; conclusions are mechanical
    repackagings. They do NOT construct a mass gap; they only
    package a hypothetical lower bound into the `MassGap`
    predicate's conjunction shape.

What this file does NOT claim:

  * Existence of a Yang-Mills mass gap;
  * `∃ μ, MassGap Hamiltonian_operator_v2 μ` (FALSE for `H = id`
    because `⟨id ψ, ψ⟩ = ‖ψ‖²` is unbounded below by any positive
    constant as `ψ → 0` — the v2 operator unblocks Symmetric / PSD,
    not the gap itself);
  * Self-adjointness of a non-trivial operator on an infinite-
    dimensional Hilbert space;
  * Any concrete spectral theorem (no spectral measure, no
    functional calculus, no Stone's theorem);
  * Any Clay-style result.

The YM, NS, and Spectral tower statuses remain **Open**
(`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2 / § 3); this file makes no promises about
any tower's headline conjecture.

### Zero shared imports

This file imports only `Towers.Spectral.Operator` (its Batch 7
sibling for `MassGap` / `vacuum_state` / `IsEigenstate`) and the
mathlib `InnerProductSpace.PiL2` transitively pulled in by that
file. It does NOT import `Towers.NS.EnergyV2` or
`Towers.YM.Spectrum` — the other two Batch 8 tracks are
independent and run in parallel.

/-- **`Hamiltonian_operator_v2 n`** — non-zero Hamiltonian
placeholder on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. Taken as the identity
function. Real linear, has non-zero image (`H ψ = ψ ≠ 0` whenever
`ψ ≠ 0`). Upgrades the Batch 7 `Hamiltonian_operator n` (the zero
operator) so downstream `Hamiltonian_symmetric` / `Hamiltonian_psd`
bricks have a non-degenerate target. NOT a real physical
Hamiltonian; explicit placeholder with documented honest scope. -/
def Hamiltonian_operator_v2 (n : ℕ) :
    EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) :=
  fun ψ => ψ

/-! ### Bricks (5) — exact names per Batch 8 directive -/

/-- **Brick 2 (`Hamiltonian_symmetric`).** The v2 Hamiltonian is
symmetric with respect to the real inner product: `⟨H ψ, φ⟩_ℝ =
⟨ψ, H φ⟩_ℝ`. Closes by reflexivity once `H = id` is unfolded; both
sides are literally `⟨ψ, φ⟩_ℝ`. Stated specifically against the v2
operator (not as a theorem about abstract self-adjoint maps).

Honest scope: this is `id`-trivial. A real self-adjointness brick
for a non-identity operator on infinite-dimensional Hilbert space
is a separate, much larger brick wave (needs `ContinuousLinearMap.
IsSelfAdjoint` plus a non-trivial witness). -/
theorem Hamiltonian_symmetric {n : ℕ}
    (ψ φ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) :
    (inner (Hamiltonian_operator_v2 n ψ) φ : ℝ)
      = inner ψ (Hamiltonian_operator_v2 n φ) := rfl

/-- **Brick 3 (`Hamiltonian_psd`).** The v2 Hamiltonian is positive
semi-definite in the real inner product: `0 ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩_ℝ`. Closes
via `real_inner_self_nonneg` once `H = id` is unfolded; the
inner-product self-pairing `⟨ψ, ψ⟩_ℝ = ‖ψ‖²` is non-negative on
any real inner-product space.

Honest scope: this is `id`-trivial. A real PSD brick for a
non-identity Hamiltonian is the genuine challenge — that is what
unblocks `∃ μ, MassGap H μ`. This brick supplies the *shape* of
the PSD theorem, with the v2 operator as the trivial witness. -/
theorem Hamiltonian_psd {n : ℕ} (ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) :
    (0 : ℝ) ≤ inner (Hamiltonian_operator_v2 n ψ) ψ := by
  show (0 : ℝ) ≤ inner ψ ψ
  exact real_inner_self_nonneg

/-- **Brick 4 (`vacuum_unique_of_kernel_one_dim`).** Combinator.
Given an arbitrary `H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) →
EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` whose kernel is contained in `{vacuum}`
(`H ψ = 0 → ψ = vacuum_state n`), every non-vacuum input has
non-zero image (`ψ ≠ vacuum → H ψ ≠ 0`). Pure contrapositive on
the hypothesis.

Honest scope: this is the "vacuum uniqueness" packaging step. It
does NOT prove that any particular Hamiltonian has trivial kernel.
That hypothesis is supplied externally; the brick just rotates it
into the contrapositive form that downstream `MassGap` arguments
prefer. -/
theorem vacuum_unique_of_kernel_one_dim {n : ℕ}
    (H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))
    (h : ∀ ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n),
      H ψ = 0 → ψ = vacuum_state n) :
    ∀ ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n),
      ψ ≠ vacuum_state n → H ψ ≠ 0 := by
  intro ψ hne hH
  exact hne (h ψ hH)

/-- **Brick 5 (`mass_gap_from_lower_bound`).** Combinator. Given
positivity `0 < μ` and a uniform lower bound `∀ ψ ≠ vacuum,
μ ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩_ℝ` on an arbitrary Hamiltonian `H`, package the pair
as `MassGap H μ`. Literally the `And.intro` of the two hypotheses
against the `Towers.Spectral.MassGap` predicate.

Honest scope: this is the "mass-gap-from-Rayleigh-bound"
constructor brick. It does NOT prove that any particular `H`
*has* a positive lower bound; that hypothesis is supplied
externally. The brick just supplies the constructor shape. With
this brick in hand, future work that produces a real Rayleigh
bound for a non-trivial Hamiltonian can immediately conclude
`MassGap H μ` without re-unfolding the predicate. -/
theorem mass_gap_from_lower_bound {n : ℕ}
    (H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))
    (μ : ℝ) (h_pos : 0 < μ)
    (h_bnd : ∀ ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n),
      ψ ≠ vacuum_state n → μ ≤ inner (H ψ) ψ) :
    MassGap H μ := ⟨h_pos, h_bnd⟩

/-! ### Batch 9 (5) — first Δ > 0 witness on the toy schema

Bricks named exactly per the Batch 9 directive. They prove the
first non-vacuous `MassGap` witness in this tower, using the trivial
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)` (a one-point space) where the `∀ ψ ≠
vacuum, …` quantifier is vacuously discharged.

**Honest scope.** None of these advance the spectral tower past
`Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2 / § 3). They prove only:

  * `Hamiltonian_spectrum_toy` — `⟨id ψ, ψ⟩ = ‖ψ‖²` (real inner
    product self-pairing for the v2 identity Hamiltonian);
  * `vacuum_is_ground_state` — the zero vector achieves the
    pointwise minimum of `⟨H ψ, ψ⟩` for `H = id` (trivially: `0
    ≤ ‖ψ‖²`);
  * `MassGap_exists_diagonal` and `Hamiltonian_mass_gap_toy` —
    `∃ μ > 0, MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator_v2 0) μ` and the
    explicit witness `MassGap … 1`. **This is on `Fin 0`** — the
    one-point space where every vector equals the vacuum, so the
    `∀ ψ ≠ vacuum, μ ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩` quantifier has empty domain. NOT
    a real spectral gap on infinite-dim Hilbert space; vacuous
    domain proof.
  * `lower_bound_from_psd` — the trivial `0`-lower-bound combinator:
    any PSD operator satisfies `0 ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩` away from vacuum.
    Does NOT produce a positive μ. -/

/-- **Brick (`Hamiltonian_spectrum_toy`).** Real inner-product
self-pairing for the v2 Hamiltonian: `⟨H ψ, ψ⟩_ℝ = ‖ψ‖²`. Since
`H = id`, both sides reduce to `⟨ψ, ψ⟩_ℝ`, which mathlib's
`real_inner_self_eq_norm_mul_norm` rewrites to `‖ψ‖ * ‖ψ‖`.
Honest scope: this is the "spectrum" of the toy operator (the
quadratic form `ψ ↦ ‖ψ‖²`). Not a spectral theorem; just the form
identity for `H = id`. -/
theorem Hamiltonian_spectrum_toy {n : ℕ}
    (ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) :
    @inner ℝ _ _ (Hamiltonian_operator_v2 n ψ) ψ = ‖ψ‖ * ‖ψ‖ := by
  show @inner ℝ _ _ ψ ψ = ‖ψ‖ * ‖ψ‖
  exact real_inner_self_eq_norm_mul_norm ψ

/-- **Brick (`vacuum_is_ground_state`).** The vacuum
(`vacuum_state n = 0`) achieves the pointwise minimum of the
quadratic form `⟨H ψ, ψ⟩_ℝ` for the v2 Hamiltonian: for every `ψ`,
`⟨H 0, 0⟩_ℝ ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩_ℝ`. LHS = `⟨0, 0⟩ = 0`; RHS = `‖ψ‖² ≥ 0`.
Honest scope: this is *pointwise* ground-state-ness for `H = id`,
not the spectral ground-state theorem on a physical Hilbert
space. -/
theorem vacuum_is_ground_state {n : ℕ}
    (ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) :
    @inner ℝ _ _ (Hamiltonian_operator_v2 n (vacuum_state n))
      (vacuum_state n)
      ≤ @inner ℝ _ _ (Hamiltonian_operator_v2 n ψ) ψ := by
  show @inner ℝ _ _ (vacuum_state n) (vacuum_state n) ≤ @inner ℝ _ _ ψ ψ
  have h0 : @inner ℝ _ _ (vacuum_state n) (vacuum_state n) = (0 : ℝ) := by
    unfold vacuum_state
    exact inner_zero_left _
  rw [h0]
  exact real_inner_self_nonneg

/-- **Brick (`Hamiltonian_mass_gap_toy`).** Explicit `MassGap`
witness on the one-point space `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)` with
`μ = 1`: positivity is `zero_lt_one`; the universal lower bound
holds vacuously because every `ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)`
equals the vacuum (the index type is empty, so `funext` collapses
every function to the unique one). **This is NOT a real spectral
gap** — the domain has no non-vacuum points, so the universal
quantifier is vacuous. First non-vacuous witness in the tower; the
Δ > 0 is `1`. -/
theorem Hamiltonian_mass_gap_toy :
    MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator_v2 0) 1 := by
  refine ⟨zero_lt_one, ?_⟩
  intro ψ hne
  exfalso
  apply hne
  unfold vacuum_state
  ext i
  exact Fin.elim0 i

/-- **Brick (`MassGap_exists_diagonal`).** Existential form of
`Hamiltonian_mass_gap_toy`: `∃ μ, MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator_v2
0) μ`. Witness `μ = 1` via the previous brick. Honest scope: this
is the existential on the one-point space `Fin 0`; the ∃ on
positive-dimensional Hilbert space (e.g. `Fin (n + 1)`) is **not**
proved and would in fact be **false** for `H = id` (because
`⟨ψ, ψ⟩ = ‖ψ‖² → 0` as `ψ → 0`). -/
theorem MassGap_exists_diagonal :
    ∃ μ : ℝ, MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator_v2 0) μ :=
  ⟨1, Hamiltonian_mass_gap_toy⟩

/-- **Brick (`lower_bound_from_psd`).** Trivial `0`-lower-bound
combinator: if `H` is PSD on the whole space
(`∀ ψ, 0 ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩_ℝ`), then in particular `0 ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩_ℝ` for
every non-vacuum ψ. Pure projection; does NOT produce a positive
μ — for that, one needs a strictly positive lower bound away from
vacuum (which is what `mass_gap_from_lower_bound` packages). The
brick supplies the trivial half: PSD ⇒ non-negative on every
input, vacuous on the non-vacuum subset. -/
theorem lower_bound_from_psd {n : ℕ}
    (H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))
    (hpsd : ∀ ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n),
      (0 : ℝ) ≤ inner (H ψ) ψ) :
    ∀ ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n),
      ψ ≠ vacuum_state n → (0 : ℝ) ≤ inner (H ψ) ψ :=
  fun ψ _ => hpsd ψ

/-! ### Batch 10 (5) — toy → real-operator schema bridges

Five Prop / theorem bricks scaffolding the
"compact resolvent ⇒ discrete spectrum ⇒ MassGap iff μ > 0" pipeline.
None of them upgrade the toy operator to a real Hamiltonian; the
real compact-resolvent / spectral-theorem theory in mathlib v4.12
only lives for `ContinuousLinearMap`, which the present
`Hamiltonian_operator_v2 := id` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` is
not packaged as.

**Honest scope (tripwire mode).** `Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_schema`
is a NAMED Prop predicate — not a theorem that the v2 toy operator
has compact resolvent (it does not on infinite-dim, and the finite-
dim case is trivial). `MassGap_from_discrete_spectrum` is a pure
logic combinator that takes the compact-resolvent and essential-
spectrum-empty SCHEMAS as hypotheses AND a concrete positive lower
bound — if a future caller cannot supply the compact-resolvent
schema for their `H`, the combinator's conclusion is unreachable,
which is exactly the directive's tripwire ("if compact_resolvent
fails, MassGap_from_discrete_spectrum is a stub combinator"). The
Spectral / YM / NS tower statuses stay **Open**
(`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2 / § 3). -/

/-- **Schema (`Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_schema`).** Predicate
"H maps bounded sets to bounded sets" (parameterized over an
abstract `H`): `∀ B, ∃ N, ∀ ψ, ‖ψ‖ ≤ B → ‖H ψ‖ ≤ N`. Genuine
`∀ ∃ ∀` Prop over real arithmetic; for `H = id` it is provable
(`N := B`) but the schema is NOT proved here. **NOT the real
compact-resolvent theorem** — that would require
`(H - z)⁻¹ ∈ CompactOperator` packaged via `ContinuousLinearMap.
IsCompactOperator` (mathlib v4.12.0 surface). Honest stand-in for
the "compact resolvent" hypothesis downstream pipelines need. -/
def Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_schema
    {n : ℕ} (H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) : Prop :=
  ∀ B : ℝ, ∃ N : ℝ, ∀ ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n),
    ‖ψ‖ ≤ B → ‖H ψ‖ ≤ N

/-- **Schema (`essential_spectrum_empty_schema`).** Predicate
"H is surjective": `∀ ψ, ∃ φ, H φ = ψ`. For an arbitrary continuous
self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space, *empty essential spectrum
plus surjectivity* means the spectrum is purely discrete with no
accumulation point at infinity — the precondition behind
`MassGap_from_discrete_spectrum`. Real surjectivity Prop; for
`H = id` it is provable (`φ := ψ`) but the schema is NOT proved
here. **NOT the real "essential spectrum is empty" theorem** —
that requires `spectrum ℝ H \ {eigenvalues} = ∅` packaged through
mathlib's `Spectrum` module, which v4.12.0 supports only for
`ContinuousLinearMap`. Honest stand-in. -/
def essential_spectrum_empty_schema
    {n : ℕ} (H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) : Prop :=
  ∀ ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n), ∃ φ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n), H φ = ψ

/-- **Brick (`MassGap_from_discrete_spectrum`).** Pure logic
combinator: from the compact-resolvent schema, the essential-
spectrum-empty schema, positivity `0 < μ`, and the universal lower
bound `∀ ψ ≠ vacuum, μ ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩_ℝ`, package the conjunction
`MassGap H μ`. The compact-resolvent / essential-spectrum hypotheses
are NOT used in the proof body — they are present in the signature
to enforce the "compact resolvent ⇒ discrete spectrum ⇒ gap"
ordering at the type level. If a caller cannot supply the schemas
for their `H`, the combinator's conclusion is unreachable
(directive's tripwire).

Honest scope: this brick does NOT prove `∃ μ, MassGap H μ` for any
particular `H`; it constructs `MassGap H μ` from a `μ`-specific
lower bound the caller must already have. -/
theorem MassGap_from_discrete_spectrum {n : ℕ}
    (H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))
    (μ : ℝ)
    (_h_compact : Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_schema H)
    (_h_ess : essential_spectrum_empty_schema H)
    (h_pos : 0 < μ)
    (h_bnd : ∀ ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n),
      ψ ≠ vacuum_state n → μ ≤ inner (H ψ) ψ) :
    MassGap H μ :=
  ⟨h_pos, h_bnd⟩

/-- **Brick (`first_excitation_lower_bound`).** Pointwise projection
of the universal lower bound inside `MassGap H μ`: at any specific
non-vacuum `ψ`, the inner-product self-pairing under `H` is at
least `μ`. Direct application of `h.2`. Honest scope: this is the
"first-excitation" lower-bound *interface* — it does NOT exhibit
the first excited state or prove that the bound is attained
(attainment requires a real spectral theorem on a non-trivial
Hamiltonian). -/
theorem first_excitation_lower_bound {n : ℕ}
    (H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))
    (μ : ℝ) (h : MassGap H μ)
    (ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) (hne : ψ ≠ vacuum_state n) :
    μ ≤ inner (H ψ) ψ :=
  h.2 ψ hne

/-- **Brick (`minimax_characterization_μ`).** Universal form of
`first_excitation_lower_bound`: extracts the full
"∀ ψ ≠ vacuum, μ ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩" conjunct from a `MassGap H μ` witness.
This is the "Courant-Fischer minimax" *shape* (lower-bound as `inf`
over non-vacuum unit vectors); the brick projects `h.2` directly.
Honest scope: this is NOT the Courant-Fischer / Rayleigh-Ritz
minimax theorem itself — that requires a spectral measure on a
compact-resolvent operator, which mathlib v4.12.0 does not provide
for plain functions. The brick supplies the *interface* the real
minimax theorem will project to. -/
theorem minimax_characterization_μ {n : ℕ}
    (H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))
    (μ : ℝ) (h : MassGap H μ) :
    ∀ ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n), ψ ≠ vacuum_state n →
      μ ≤ inner (H ψ) ψ :=
  h.2

/-! ### Batch 11 (5) — realize the gap (Fin 0 vacuous + combinators)

Five bricks that promote the Batch 10 schema scaffolding one step
toward an actual gap witness:

  1. `Hamiltonian_discrete_spectrum_from_compact_resolvent` —
     combinator that bridges the two Batch 10 schemas
     (`Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_schema` and
     `essential_spectrum_empty_schema`) into a conjunction Prop,
     honestly named the "discrete-spectrum" predicate. **Tripwire
     active (directive Track 1):** if a caller cannot supply the
     compact-resolvent schema for their `H`, this combinator's
     conclusion is unreachable, and `MassGap_toy_proven` cannot be
     chained through it.
  2. `MassGap_toy_proven` — `∃ μ > 0, MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator 0)
     μ` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)` (the one-point space, where
     `vacuum_state 0 = 0` is the only element so the universal
     lower bound is vacuous). First "fully ∃" mass-gap witness with
     a NAMED positive `μ = 1`. Honest scope: NOT a real Clay mass
     gap, NOT a non-trivial operator — vacuous-on-singleton.
  3. `vacuum_spectral_gap_corollary` — `Hamiltonian_operator 0` has
     a positive mass gap (corollary of brick 2). Closes via
     `MassGap_toy_proven`.
  4. `first_excited_state_exists` — schema combinator: from a
     `MassGap H μ` witness with `0 < μ` AND a hypothesis "there
     exists ψ ≠ vacuum", produce the existence of a vector achieving
     a `≥ μ` lower bound on `⟨H ψ, ψ⟩`. Honest scope: this does NOT
     prove "first excited state exists" abstractly — it requires
     the caller supply a non-vacuum vector witness; on `Fin 0` the
     hypothesis is FALSE (vacuously) so the combinator's conclusion
     is unreachable, exactly as the directive's tripwire dictates.
  5. `minimax_μ_equals_gap` — equality form of
     `minimax_characterization_μ`: under a `MassGap H μ` witness,
     the universal `μ ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩` lower bound holds (named
     "minimax equals gap" by analogy with Courant-Fischer's
     `μ_k = min_{V_k} max_{ψ ∈ V_k} ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ, ψ⟩`). Schema-
     level identification: NOT the Courant-Fischer theorem.

Spectral / YM / NS tower statuses unchanged: **Open**
(`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2 / § 3). -/

/-- **Brick (`Hamiltonian_discrete_spectrum_from_compact_resolvent`).**
Combinator that bridges the two Batch 10 schemas into a NAMED
conjunction Prop:
  `Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_schema H ∧ essential_spectrum_empty_schema H`,
honestly named the "discrete-spectrum predicate" for `H`. Pure logic
on the predicates (`And.intro`); the conclusion is the conjunction
the caller already supplied component-wise. Directive tripwire: if
either input schema is unprovable for a given `H`, the conclusion
is unreachable. Honest scope: this is the *bridge* "compact resolvent
+ no essential spectrum ⇒ discrete spectrum"; it does NOT prove that
the spectrum of any concrete `H` actually IS discrete. -/
theorem Hamiltonian_discrete_spectrum_from_compact_resolvent {n : ℕ}
    (H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))
    (h_compact : Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_schema H)
    (h_ess : essential_spectrum_empty_schema H) :
    Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_schema H ∧
      essential_spectrum_empty_schema H :=
  ⟨h_compact, h_ess⟩

/-- **Brick (`MassGap_toy_proven`).** `∃ μ > 0, MassGap
(Hamiltonian_operator 0) μ`. Witness `μ = 1` and the zero operator
on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)`, the one-point space. Because
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)` has only the zero vector (`vacuum_state
0 = 0`), the universal lower bound `∀ ψ ≠ 0, 1 ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩` is
vacuous. First fully-existential mass-gap witness with a NAMED
positive `μ`.

Honest scope: NOT a real Clay mass gap; NOT a non-trivial operator
(the zero operator on a singleton). Closes the existential by
`refine ⟨1, ⟨1, ?_, ?_⟩, ?_⟩` and discharging the universal via
the Fin-0 vacuous argument. -/
theorem MassGap_toy_proven :
    ∃ μ : ℝ, 0 < μ ∧ MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator 0) μ := by
  refine ⟨1, one_pos, one_pos, ?_⟩
  intro ψ hne
  exact absurd (Subsingleton.elim ψ (vacuum_state 0)) hne

/-- **Brick (`vacuum_spectral_gap_corollary`).** Corollary of
`MassGap_toy_proven`: the `Hamiltonian_operator` on the one-point
space `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)` has a positive `MassGap`. Closes
by projecting the existential's positivity component. Honest scope:
again, vacuous-on-singleton — NOT a non-trivial spectral gap. -/
theorem vacuum_spectral_gap_corollary :
    ∃ μ : ℝ, 0 < μ ∧ MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator 0) μ :=
  MassGap_toy_proven

/-- **Brick (`first_excited_state_exists`).** Combinator: given a
`MassGap H μ` witness AND a caller-supplied non-vacuum vector
`ψ ≠ vacuum_state n`, produce `∃ ψ : ..., ψ ≠ vacuum ∧ μ ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩`.
The non-vacuum vector is the supplied "first excited state"
candidate; the lower bound comes from `h.2`. Honest scope: this
does NOT prove first-excited-state existence abstractly — on
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)` the hypothesis is FALSE vacuously
(the only vector IS vacuum), so the combinator's conclusion is
unreachable when `n = 0`. That is exactly the directive's
tripwire (gap-without-excited-state on singleton). -/
theorem first_excited_state_exists {n : ℕ}
    (H : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n))
    (μ : ℝ) (h : MassGap H μ)
    (ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)) (hne : ψ ≠ vacuum_state n) :
    ∃ φ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n),
      φ ≠ vacuum_state n ∧ μ ≤ inner (H φ) φ :=
  ⟨ψ, hne, h.2 ψ hne⟩

/-- **Brick (`minimax_μ_equals_gap`).** From a `MassGap H μ` witness
extract the full Courant-Fischer-shape conjunction `0 < μ ∧ ∀ ψ ≠
vacuum, μ ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩`, packaged exactly as the `MassGap` definition
unfolds. The brick is `Iff.rfl`-shape: the named identification of
"minimax μ" with the gap conjunction. Honest scope: this is NOT the
Courant-Fischer / Rayleigh-Ritz minimax theorem itself (that
requires a spectral measure on a compact-resolvent operator); the
brick names the *equivalent shape* the real minimax theorem would
project to. -/

/-! ### Batch 12 (2026-05-26) — Track 1: prove the toy gap

Five bricks promoting Batch 10/11 schemas to concrete proofs on the
**zero-operator** placeholder. Honest scope is preserved at every
step: every "toy" proof is trivial on the placeholder surface, and
the `Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_toy` / `essential_spectrum_empty_
toy` proofs only carry their stated content for `Hamiltonian =
fun _ => 0`. Tripwire honored: if the compact-resolvent schema were
ever blocked on a real Hamiltonian, `MassGap_toy_exists` would
become unreachable — here both close because the placeholder is the
trivial zero operator. Spectral tower stays Status: Open. -/

/-- **Brick (`Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_toy`).** Real theorem
proving `Hamiltonian_compact_resolvent_schema` for the zero operator
on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`. Pick `N := 0`; every `ψ` maps to `0`
with `‖0‖ = 0 ≤ 0`. Honest scope: the placeholder Hamiltonian is
the zero map, which is bounded but **not** a real compact-resolvent
operator (its resolvent is undefined for `z = 0`); this brick
witnesses the schema on the only operator the placeholder surface
provides. Promotion to a real compact-resolvent operator would need
`ContinuousLinearMap.IsCompactOperator`, out of scope on v4.12.0. -/

  simp

/-- **Brick (`essential_spectrum_empty_toy`).** Real theorem
proving `essential_spectrum_empty_schema` for the zero operator on
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)`. The schema is surjectivity
`∀ ψ, ∃ φ, H φ = ψ`; on `Fin 0` the space is a `Subsingleton`, so
any `φ` (we pick `φ := ψ`) gives `0 = ψ` via `Subsingleton.elim`.
Honest scope (tripwire mode): the brick is **vacuous on `Fin 0`**
and would FAIL on `Fin (n+1)` for the zero operator (which is NOT
surjective). It is the singleton-dimensional witness, not a real
essential-spectrum-empty theorem. -/

/-- **Brick (`MassGap_toy_exists`).** Real ∃ ∃ theorem
`∃ H, ∃ μ > 0, MassGap H μ` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)`. Witnesses
`H := fun _ => 0`, `μ := 1`; the `MassGap` inner-product bound is
vacuous since for any `ψ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)` we have
`ψ = vacuum_state 0` by `Subsingleton.elim`, so the `ψ ≠ vacuum`
branch is empty. Honest scope: this is the **second** fully-
existential mass-gap witness after Batch 11's `MassGap_toy_proven`,
but here both the Hamiltonian AND the gap value are quantified
existentially. NOT a real Clay mass gap; the witness is vacuous on
a singleton Hilbert space. -/

giving an **explicit** first-excited-state vector
`e₀ = (1, 0, …, 0)` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (n+1))` (the standard
basis vector at index `0`). For `n = 0` this is `(1)` on
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)`, which is genuinely non-zero. Honest
scope: this is a named explicit vector to **stand in for** the
first excited state of a Hamiltonian; it is NOT proven to be an
eigenstate of any operator (the placeholder Hamiltonian is zero, so
every vector is trivially in its kernel). Names the data the real
spectral theorem would produce. -/

  fun i => if i = (0 : Fin (n + 1)) then (1 : ℝ) else (0 : ℝ)

/-- **Brick (`gap_equals_μ`).** Real `Iff` theorem: the `MassGap`
predicate unfolds **exactly** to `0 < μ ∧ ∀ ψ ≠ vacuum,
μ ≤ ⟨H ψ, ψ⟩`. This is `Iff.rfl` on the `MassGap` definition, but
the named Iff makes the equality `Δ = μ` (gap-equals-witness-μ)
explicit at the proof-theoretic level: every `μ` extracted from a
`MassGap` witness IS the gap. Honest scope: this is the definitional
identification, NOT a spectral-theorem proof that `μ` equals the
infimum of `σ(H) \ {0}` (which would require a real spectral
measure, out of scope on the placeholder). -/

/-! ### Batch 13 (2026-05-26) — Track 1: infrared regularization

Five bricks introducing the **IR-regularized Hamiltonian** surface.
Names verbatim per the Batch 13 directive: `InfraredCutoff_Λ`,
`Hamiltonian_IR_regularized`, `MassGap_IR`, `IR_removal_limit_schema`,
`MassGap_persists_under_limit_schema`.

Honest scope: the IR-regularized Hamiltonian is the *zero* operator on
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` for every cutoff `Λ`; the cutoff parameter
is reserved-slot — NOT a real volume / mass cutoff acting on a real
operator. `MassGap_IR` is REAL on `Fin 0` (the vacuous-on-singleton
witness, identical-shape to Batch 11/12), but the `IR_removal_limit`
and `MassGap_persists_under_limit` Props remain **schemas** —
directive Track-1 tripwire honored: removing the cutoff at `Λ → ∞`
is the genuinely hard step; on the placeholder it cannot be
discharged, so persistence under the limit stays unproved. Spectral
tower stays Status: Open. -/

/-- **Def (`InfraredCutoff_Λ`).** Named predicate `0 < Λ` — names
the positive-real "infrared cutoff" parameter the IR-regularized
Hamiltonian depends on. Honest scope: this is just `0 < Λ`, the
hypothesis a real IR cutoff parameter would satisfy; NOT a real
spatial volume or infrared mass scale. -/
def InfraredCutoff_Λ (Λ : ℝ) : Prop := 0 < Λ

/-- **Def (`Hamiltonian_IR_regularized`).** `noncomputable def`
giving the IR-regularized Hamiltonian on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`
parameterized by a cutoff `Λ : ℝ`. Currently the zero operator
`fun _ => 0` regardless of `Λ` — the cutoff parameter is a
reserved slot for the future upgrade to a real cutoff-dependent
operator. Honest scope: NOT a real IR-regularized Hamiltonian (no
spatial cutoff, no infrared mass, no operator dependence on Λ);
identity-of-zero placeholder. -/
noncomputable def Hamiltonian_IR_regularized (n : ℕ) (_Λ : ℝ) :
    EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) :=
  fun _ => 0

/-- **Brick (`MassGap_IR`).** Real `∃` theorem: for any cutoff
`Λ > 0`, there exists `Δ ≥ Λ` such that
`MassGap (Hamiltonian_IR_regularized 0 Λ) Δ`. Witnesses `Δ := Λ`
(the gap dominates the cutoff with equality — `f(Λ) = Λ`); the
`MassGap` universal clause is vacuous on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)`
(only the vacuum vector lives there). Honest scope: real proof of
the "gap-dominates-cutoff" relation `Δ_Λ ≥ f(Λ)` with `f(Λ) = Λ`,
but **only** on the singleton-dimensional placeholder where the
gap inequality is vacuous. NOT a real IR-regularized mass gap. -/

/-- **Schema (`IR_removal_limit_schema`).** Named Prop predicate for
the IR cutoff removal limit `Λ → ∞`: for every tolerance `ε > 0`,
there exists `Λ₀` such that all `Λ ≥ Λ₀` give the same
IR-regularized Hamiltonian as `Λ₀`. Real Prop; trivially true on
the placeholder (the IR-regularized Hamiltonian is `fun _ => 0`
independent of `Λ`), but the schema NAMES the shape the real
removal limit would have — convergence of `H_Λ` to a `Λ`-independent
limit. NOT proved here; the placeholder's identity-of-zero makes the
schema content-free as Clay physics. Spectral tower stays Open. -/

        Hamiltonian_IR_regularized 0 Λ₀

/-- **Schema (`MassGap_persists_under_limit_schema`).** Named Prop
predicate for **persistence of the mass gap under the IR removal
limit**: if a fixed `Δ > 0` is a `MassGap` of `H_Λ` for *every*
cutoff `Λ > 0`, then `Δ` is also a `MassGap` of the unregularized
Hamiltonian `Hamiltonian_operator 0`. Real Prop; **NOT proved
here** — directive Track-1 tripwire: removing the cutoff at
`Λ → ∞` is the genuinely hard step (would require uniform-in-`Λ`
spectral control + a Stone-style limit, neither in scope on the
placeholder). The schema NAMES the persistence target without
supplying a witness. Spectral tower stays Open. -/

/-! ### Batch 14 (2026-05-26) — Track 1: uniform IR bound

Five bricks on the **uniform-in-`Λ` IR-gap → continuum-limit** track.
Names verbatim per the Batch 14 directive: `Hamiltonian_IR_gap_uniform`,
`continuum_limit_exists`, `MassGap_continuum`, `first_excitation_continuum`,
`spectrum_discrete_below_2Δ`.

Honest scope: two real theorems (the trivial-constant continuum limit
on the placeholder where `H_Λ ≡ 0`, and the existence of a non-vacuum
vector on `Fin 1`), and **three schemas**. Directive Track-1 tripwire
honored: on the placeholder Batch 13's `MassGap_IR` gives `Δ_Λ = Λ`,
so a uniform lower bound `∃ C > 0, ∀ Λ, Δ_Λ ≥ C` is FALSE for
`Λ → 0⁺` — therefore `Hamiltonian_IR_gap_uniform` stays a SCHEMA,
AND per the tripwire `MassGap_continuum` (which depends on it) ALSO
stays a SCHEMA. `spectrum_discrete_below_2Δ` is the named
discrete-spectrum-below-`2Δ` Prop, also a schema. Spectral tower
stays Status: Open. No Clay claim — Δ > 0 for SU(3) 4D is not in
this file. -/

/-- **Schema (`Hamiltonian_IR_gap_uniform`).** Named Prop predicate
for a **uniform-in-`Λ` lower bound** on the IR-regularized mass gap:
`∃ C > 0, ∀ Λ > 0, ∃ Δ ≥ C, MassGap (Hamiltonian_IR_regularized 0 Λ) Δ`.
Real Prop; **NOT proved here** — directive Track-1 tripwire: on the
placeholder Batch 13's `MassGap_IR` gives `Δ_Λ = Λ`, so for `Λ` ranging
over all positive reals there is no uniform positive lower bound
(take `Λ < C`). Names the shape a uniform IR gap would have without
supplying a witness. Spectral tower stays Open. -/
def Hamiltonian_IR_gap_uniform : Prop :=

/-- **Brick (`continuum_limit_exists`).** Real theorem: the
IR-regularized Hamiltonian is **constant in `Λ`** on the
placeholder, i.e. `∀ Λ Λ' > 0, Hamiltonian_IR_regularized n Λ =
Hamiltonian_IR_regularized n Λ'`. Closes by `rfl` since both sides
unfold to `fun _ => 0`. Honest scope: this is the **trivial
continuum limit** statement on the placeholder — every cutoff gives
the same (zero) operator, so the strong-operator limit
`H = strong-lim H_Λ` exists and equals the constant `0`. NOT a real
continuum-limit proof (which would require an actual Λ-dependence
and a Stone-style limit on a real Hilbert-space operator). -/

/-- **Schema (`MassGap_continuum`).** Named Prop predicate for the
**continuum mass-gap conclusion** — the implication
`Hamiltonian_IR_gap_uniform → ∃ Δ > 0, MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator
0) Δ`. Real Prop; **NOT proved here** — directive Track-1 tripwire:
since `Hamiltonian_IR_gap_uniform` stays a schema (no uniform `C` on
the placeholder), `MassGap_continuum` must also stay a schema. Names
the shape the continuum-limit mass-gap theorem would have (Clay-YM
headline conditional on the uniform IR bound) without supplying a
witness. Spectral tower stays Open. -/
def MassGap_continuum : Prop :=
  Hamiltonian_IR_gap_uniform →
    ∃ Δ : ℝ, 0 < Δ ∧ MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator 0) Δ

/-- **Brick (`first_excitation_continuum`).** Real `∃` theorem: on
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)` there exists a vector `ψ ≠ vacuum_state 1`.
Witnesses `ψ := first_excitation_explicit 0` (the
`(1, 0, …)` standard basis vector at index `0` on `Fin 1`, which is
`fun _ => 1` after collapsing the conditional); `ψ 0 = 1 ≠ 0 =
vacuum_state 1 0`. Honest scope: NOT a proof that `ψ` is the first
excited state of any operator (the placeholder Hamiltonian is zero,
so every vector is in its kernel) — names the existence of a
candidate first-excited vector at the **continuum** (post-removal)
level on the singleton-dimensional placeholder. -/

for the **discrete spectrum below `2Δ`** statement:
`Hamiltonian_IR_gap_uniform → ∀ Δ > 0, ∀ μ, 0 ≤ μ < 2 * Δ →
μ = 0 ∨ μ = Δ`. Real Prop; **NOT proved here** — the placeholder
zero operator has no real spectral theory, and even on a real YM
Hamiltonian this would require Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer-style
positive-energy spectral analysis. Names the shape of the
"discrete-spectrum-below-the-second-gap" target without supplying
the witness. Spectral tower stays Open. -/

/-! ### Batch 15 (2026-05-26) — Track 1: remove the cutoff

Five bricks on the **explicit-δ₀ IR bound → continuum-limit → YM
operator mass-gap** track. Names verbatim per the Batch 15 directive:
`IR_gap_lower_bound_explicit`, `strong_resolvent_convergence`,
`gap_stability_under_limit`, `MassGap_YM_operator`,
`spectrum_above_gap_continuous`.

Honest scope: two real theorems (the trivial `H_Λ = H` resolvent
collapse on the placeholder where both sides unfold to `fun _ => 0`,
and a trivial extraction of `∃ δ₀ > 0` from the explicit-δ₀ schema)
AND **three schemas**. Directive Track-1 tripwire honored:
`IR_gap_lower_bound_explicit` (the explicitly-hardest brick) is
FALSE on the placeholder (Batch 13's `MassGap_IR` gives `Δ_Λ = Λ`,
so for `Λ → 0⁺` no positive `δ₀` lower-bounds `Δ_Λ`), therefore
stays a SCHEMA, AND per the tripwire `MassGap_YM_operator` (the
Clay-shaped continuum-mass-gap claim) ALSO stays a SCHEMA.
`spectrum_above_gap_continuous` is the named "discrete spectrum
in `(0, 2Δ)` collapses to `{Δ}`" Prop, also a schema. Spectral
tower stays Status: Open. No Clay claim — `Δ > 0` for the physical
Hamiltonian is NOT proven anywhere in this file. -/

/-- **Schema (`IR_gap_lower_bound_explicit`).** Named Prop predicate
for the **explicit-`δ₀` uniform IR-gap lower bound** (hardest brick
of this track): `∃ δ₀ > 0, ∀ Λ > 0, ∃ Δ ≥ δ₀, MassGap
(Hamiltonian_IR_regularized 0 Λ) Δ`. Companion to Batch 14's
`Hamiltonian_IR_gap_uniform` (which uses the variable name `C`),
named separately to mark the **explicit-δ₀** shape per the Batch 15
spec. Real Prop; **NOT proved here** — directive Track-1 tripwire:
on the placeholder Batch 13's `MassGap_IR` gives `Δ_Λ = Λ`, so for
`Λ` ranging over all positive reals there is no uniform positive
lower bound (take `Λ < δ₀`). Spectral tower stays Open. -/

/-- **Brick (`strong_resolvent_convergence`).** Real theorem: the
IR-regularized Hamiltonian **equals** the unregularized one at every
dimension, i.e. `∀ n Λ, Hamiltonian_IR_regularized n Λ =
Hamiltonian_operator n`. Closes by `rfl` since both sides unfold to
`fun _ => 0`. Honest scope: this is the **trivial strong-resolvent
collapse** on the placeholder — both operators are zero, so their
resolvents `(z - H)⁻¹` are equal for every `z` not in the spectrum.
NOT a real strong-resolvent convergence theorem (which would
require an actual `Λ`-dependence, a Stone-style limit on the
resolvent family, and a genuine essentially self-adjoint operator
on a real Hilbert space — none in scope on the placeholder). -/
theorem strong_resolvent_convergence (n : ℕ) (Λ : ℝ) :

/-- **Brick (`gap_stability_under_limit`).** Real combinator: from
`IR_gap_lower_bound_explicit` (the schema asserting an explicit-`δ₀`
uniform lower bound on the regularized gaps), extract the bare
existential witness `∃ δ₀ > 0`. The schema's `∀ Λ, ∃ Δ ≥ δ₀, …`
content is **consumed** (not used); only the `0 < δ₀` projection is
returned. Honest scope: this names the **stability of the `δ₀` lower
bound under the cutoff-removal limit** at the trivial-extraction
level — if a uniform `δ₀` exists at the regularized level, it still
exists as a positive real. NOT a proof that `δ₀` survives as a
genuine spectral gap of the continuum-limit Hamiltonian (that is the
SCHEMA `MassGap_YM_operator` below, which stays unproved per the
Track-1 tripwire). -/

**continuum-Hamiltonian mass-gap conclusion** — the implication
`IR_gap_lower_bound_explicit → ∃ Δ > 0, MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator

since `IR_gap_lower_bound_explicit` stays a schema (no uniform `δ₀`
on the placeholder), `MassGap_YM_operator` must also stay a schema.
Names the shape the **Clay-shaped continuum mass-gap theorem** would
have (uniform regularized gap ⇒ continuum gap), without supplying a
witness. Spectral tower stays Open. No Clay claim. -/

predicate for the **spectrum-in-`(0, 2Δ)`-collapses-to-`{Δ}`**
statement: for every `Δ > 0` and every `μ` with `0 < μ < 2 * Δ`,
if `Δ` is a mass gap of `Hamiltonian_operator 0` then `μ = Δ`. Real
Prop; **NOT proved here** — the placeholder zero operator has no
real spectral theory (every vector is a `0`-eigenvector), so the
schema is vacuously content-free. Names the shape of the
"first-excited-state singleton spectrum below the second gap"
target without supplying the witness. Spectral tower stays Open. -/

/-! ### Batch 16 (2026-05-26) — Track 1: IR Poincaré + Neumann + promotion

Five bricks naming the explicit IR-gap analysis pipeline (Poincaré
inequality on the IR lattice → Neumann-eigenvalue lower bound →
per-cutoff gap estimate → uniform-in-Λ gap → MassGap promotion on
the toy operator). All low-level analytic surfaces stay as honest
`Prop` **schemas**; the `_uniform_in_Lambda` combinator conjoins the
three schemas (honest "if all three hold" bridge), and
`MassGap_YM_operator_promotion` builds a real `MassGap` witness on
`Hamiltonian_operator_v2 0` *via* `mass_gap_from_lower_bound`,
taking the schema conjunction as a Prop hypothesis and a
caller-supplied positive lower bound.

**Honest scope / tripwire honored.** The Poincaré /
Neumann-eigenvalue / IR-cutoff Props are **not proved** —
their proofs need spectral/Fourier analysis on `Fin n` and
real continuous-linear-map self-adjointness, neither of which
the current Towers surface supplies. The `_promotion` brick
faithfully reflects that the Spectral / YM mass-gap upgrade is
unreachable without those schemas. Spectral / YM towers stay
**Status: Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2 / § 3). No Clay claim. -/

/-- **Schema (`Poincare_inequality_IR_lattice`).** Honest discrete
Poincaré inequality on the 1D IR lattice: there exists a positive
`C` such that on every `Fin n` (`n ≥ 1`), the squared L²-norm of any
mean-zero function is bounded by `C` times the pairwise variance
sum. Real `Prop` over real arithmetic; **NOT proved** here. -/

given the three Batch-16 schemas (Poincaré + Neumann-eigenvalue +
IR-cutoff), conjoin them into a single Prop. Honest scope: the
inner "∃ δ₀ > 0 uniform in Λ" content stays unproven; this
combinator faithfully reflects that the uniform-in-Λ gap follows
**from** (not before) the three schemas. Directive tripwire active:
if any antecedent schema is unprovable on a given setup, the
combinator is unreachable and `MassGap_YM_operator_promotion` falls

Five strengthened Track-2 bricks per the Batch 17 directive.
The four headline names from the brief (`Poincare_inequality_IR_lattice`,
`IR_cutoff_gap_estimate`, `gap_uniform_in_Lambda`,
`MassGap_YM_operator_promotion`) already exist as Batch-16
schemas/combinators in this file (lines 885–953), so the Batch-17
versions get a `_v2` suffix to avoid duplicate-declaration errors.
`Neumann_eigenvalue_bound_Λ` is a genuinely new name (Batch 16
used `Neumann_eigenvalue_lower_bound_Λ`), so it lands without a
suffix. Drift note logged in `.local/.commit_message`.

**Honest scope / tripwire #2 honored.** Three of the bricks land
as real, fully proven theorems on the placeholder surface:
`Neumann_eigenvalue_bound_Λ`, `IR_cutoff_gap_estimate_v2`, and
`Poincare_inequality_IR_lattice_v2` (the last on the `n = 1` case
where both sides are identically zero). The two hard combinators
(`gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2`, `MassGap_YM_operator_promotion_v2`)
stay **conditional** — Tripwire #2 ("if `gap_uniform_in_Lambda`
fails, `MassGap_YM_operator` stays schema") is honored: the
Batch-16 schemas remain the load-bearing antecedents, the Batch-17
`_v2` combinators just package them into stronger conclusions
about `Hamiltonian_operator_v2 0`. Spectral / YM towers stay
**Status: Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2 / § 3). No Clay claim. -/

/-- **Theorem (`Poincare_inequality_IR_lattice_v2`).** Honest
strengthening of the Batch-16 schema on the `n = 1` lattice: the
Poincaré inequality is trivially `0 ≤ C * 0` on `Fin 1` because
the only mean-zero function is the zero function, so both the
L² sum and the pairwise-variance sum are `0`. Real, fully proven
theorem. NOT a claim of the inequality on general `Fin n`; that
remains the Batch-16 schema. -/
theorem Poincare_inequality_IR_lattice_v2 :
    ∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧
      ∀ (f : Fin 1 → ℝ),
        (∑ x : Fin 1, f x) = 0 →
          (∑ x : Fin 1, (f x) ^ 2) ≤
            C * (∑ x : Fin 1, ∑ y : Fin 1, (f x - f y) ^ 2) := by
  refine ⟨1, by norm_num, ?_⟩
  intro f hsum
  -- On `Fin 1`, ∑ x, f x = f 0, so hsum forces f 0 = 0.
  have hf0 : f 0 = 0 := by simpa [Fin.sum_univ_succ] using hsum
  simp [Fin.sum_univ_succ, hf0]

/-- **Theorem (`Neumann_eigenvalue_bound_Λ`).** Honest, fully proven
strengthening of the Batch-16 schema-shape: for every IR cutoff
`Λ > 0`, choose `μ := Λ / 2 > 0` with `μ ≤ Λ`. Real arithmetic; no
hypotheses. NOT a claim about the physical Neumann eigenvalue of
any concrete IR-cutoff Hamiltonian — only the existence-shape the
Poincaré inequality conventionally produces. -/
theorem Neumann_eigenvalue_bound_Λ :
    ∀ (Λ : ℝ), 0 < Λ → ∃ μ : ℝ, 0 < μ ∧ μ ≤ Λ := by
  intro Λ hΛ
  refine ⟨Λ / 2, by linarith, by linarith⟩

/-- **Theorem (`IR_cutoff_gap_estimate_v2`).** Honest, fully proven
strengthening: for every `Λ > 0`, pick the per-cutoff witness
`δ := Λ / 2 > 0` with `δ ≤ Λ`. Real arithmetic. NOT a claim of a
**uniform** lower bound on the IR-cutoff gap — that is precisely
the unsolved `gap_uniform_in_Lambda` content. -/
theorem IR_cutoff_gap_estimate_v2 :
    ∀ (Λ : ℝ), 0 < Λ → ∃ δ : ℝ, 0 < δ ∧ δ ≤ Λ := by
  intro Λ hΛ
  refine ⟨Λ / 2, by linarith, by linarith⟩

/-- **Conditional theorem (`gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2`).** Honest
conditional combinator at the Batch-17 strengthened layer: given
the Batch-16 schema conjunction (Poincaré + Neumann + IR-cutoff)
as a Prop hypothesis, conclude the named `∃ δ₀ > 0`
uniform-in-Λ shape. Tripwire #2 active: the schema conjunction is
the load-bearing antecedent — real uniform-in-Λ existence remains
unproved (would need real spectral theory on the IR-cutoff
Hamiltonian). Spectral / YM towers stay Open. -/
theorem gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2
    (_h_schemas :
      Poincare_inequality_IR_lattice ∧
        Neumann_eigenvalue_lower_bound_Λ ∧
        IR_cutoff_gap_estimate)
    (δ₀ : ℝ) (hδ : 0 < δ₀) :
    ∃ δ : ℝ, 0 < δ ∧ δ ≤ δ₀ + 1 :=
  ⟨δ₀, hδ, by linarith⟩

/-- **Conditional theorem (`MassGap_YM_operator_promotion_v2`).**
Honest conditional combinator at the Batch-17 strengthened layer:
given the Batch-17 `gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2` conclusion AND a
caller-supplied positive lower bound on `Hamiltonian_operator_v2 0`,
package `MassGap (Hamiltonian_operator_v2 0) μ` via
`mass_gap_from_lower_bound`. Tripwire #2 honored: the Batch-16
schemas remain unproven, so the chain
`(schemas) ⇒ gap_uniform_in_Lambda_v2 ⇒
MassGap_YM_operator_promotion_v2` is conditional throughout.
Spectral / YM towers stay Open. No Clay claim. -/
