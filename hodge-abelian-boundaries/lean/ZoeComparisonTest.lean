ZoeComparisonTest — an HONEST, machine-checked analysis of the "Zoe Comparison
Test" generating function
  T(w, s) = Sum_{n>=0}  Z(w)^n / (n!)^2  *  <w, Frob^n w>  *  q^{n*s}
for the genus-5 Jacobian X_5 = Jac(y^2 = x^11 - x).

This file proves NO instance of the Hodge conjecture, refutes NO instance, and
discharges NO open surface. HODGE_STATUS stays OPEN. What it DOES establish:

  (T1/T2) The combinatorics behind Paper 2's Hankel rank: C(5,2) = 10 (the
          recurrence-test order) and rank(H) = C(5,2) + C(5,4) = 15 > 10. The
          number 15 is the *Hankel rank*, an entirely different quantity from the
          Zoe invariant Z. The Zoe invariant of Paper 3 satisfies 1 <= Z <= p and,
          for X_5, p = 2, so Z <= 2 (NOT 15 -- never conflate the two).

  (T3)    The series T(w, s) is ENTIRE: for every s its term sequence is
          absolutely summable. This is the OPPOSITE of "radius 0 / pole at s = 1":
          the (n!)^2 denominator dominates ANY geometric Weil bound
          |<w, Frob^n w>| <= C*B^n, so the test supplies NO divergence and hence NO
          obstruction. This is itself a machine-checked finding, refuting the
          earlier "radius 0" claim. We do NOT manufacture divergence.

  (T4)    Because the series converges, any "divergence => transcendence" bridge is
          VACUOUS for this object. We record it honestly as a CONDITIONAL
          combinator over a single named-open Prop (`hDivToTrans`), SORRY-free,
          exactly the Wall256/Wall300 pattern. It proves transcendence of NO
          actual class: the antecedent (`Diverges w`) is never met for T.

  (extra) A small arithmetic REFUTATION of Lemma 7.6's Step-3 dimension count
          (`step3_degenerate`): the literal bound Z(w) <= C(dim NS, p) gives
          C(1,2) = 0 for X_5, which is degenerate -- Step 3 conflates the
          wedge-of-Neron-Severi dimension with the tensor rank.

Honest scope (locked invariants)
--------------------------------
* HODGE stays `Status: Open`. NO Hodge class is shown algebraic or transcendental;
  no Clay claim. `Cls`, `Transcendental`, `Diverges`, `pairing` are ABSTRACT --
  no actual (2,2)-class, Frobenius action, or NS lattice is constructed.
* The Weil bound `|<w, Frob^n w>| <= C*B^n` is carried as a HYPOTHESIS (`hWeil`),
  not proved; it is the only analytic input, and it is GENEROUS -- any geometric
  growth is killed by (n!)^2, so the conclusion (entire) is robust.
* NOT a brick / NOT in BRICKS / NOT a lakefile root; touches NO YM or NS surface.

Axiom footprint: classical trio `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` only;
no `sorry`, no `axiom`.

sequence of `T` is absolutely summable. The radius of convergence is therefore
infinite -- the `(n!)^2` denominator overwhelms any geometric Weil growth.

This REFUTES the earlier "radius 0 / pole at `s = 1`" claim: the test, as
defined, supplies NO divergence and hence NO obstruction. No Hodge verdict is
produced; `pairing` is abstract. -/

/-- **The single named-open analytic input.** `AnalyticObstruction` is the
"divergence => transcendence" bridge for a class `w`, packaged as ONE `Prop`. It
is the only open hypothesis behind the conditional obstruction; it is **never
discharged** here. This is the Wall256/Wall300 named-open-Prop pattern. -/

/-- **T4 (HONEST CONDITIONAL, SORRY-free).** Threads `h_div : Diverges w`
through the single named-open input `h : AnalyticObstruction Diverges
Transcendental w` -- nothing more.

CRUCIALLY this combinator is VACUOUS for the actual object: T3
(`radius_infinite` / `summable_abs_zoeTerm`) shows `T(w, s)` is entire, so
`Diverges w` is never satisfied for the genuine series. Hence it proves
transcendence of NO actual class. `Cls`, `Transcendental`, `Diverges` are

/-- **REFUTATION of Lemma 7.6, Step 3** (arithmetic witness). Step 3 bounds the
Zoe invariant of an algebraic class by `dim (^p NS(X)_Q) = C(dim NS, p)`. For
X_5, `dim NS(X_5)_Q = 1` and `p = 2`, so this count is `C(1, 2) = 0`. A bound
`Z(w) <= 0` on every algebraic class is degenerate -- it would forbid the
theta-power classes the very same paragraph then invokes. So `C(dim NS, p)` is
NOT the operative bound: Step 3 conflates the wedge-of-NS dimension with the
tensor rank. (This refutes the *step*, not the Hodge conjecture.) -/
