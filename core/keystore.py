"""
Persistent API key store for Zerobeacon MF 1000.

Keys survive server restarts by writing to a JSON file. The file is kept at
KEY_PATH (writable on Fly.io). On startup the main app calls `load()`.

Key format:  zbk_<32 hex chars>
Tier values: "free" | "pro_10" | "pro_100" | "enterprise_1000"

Session IDs (from Stripe checkout success redirects) are cryptographically
random and known only to the paying customer — they serve as proof of payment
for the one-time key-retrieval flow.
